					<p>The automotive industry has been using 3D printing for a long time for prototyping parts and models. A few years ago, a man named Michele Anoe designed and printed a drivable car. The CEO of the transportation company that owns the car says that his company's goals are to speed up car manufacturing and address 3D printings greatest challenge: making useful and complete products. Their biggest target for innovation was to reduce the typical party count of a car from tens of thousands to just 49 in this car. Also, this car proved that the pace of car development can be quickened. While designing a car can take anywhere from four to seven years, this car was designed and printed in one year.</p>

					<p>3D printing can be used by architects. In an interview I conducted with the architect that designed my school, he said that: "creating the scale models is an extremely laborious and time-consuming process, and that is important for him to communicate his design with the customer." He then started using a 3D printer to make the models. He said that he can quickly and easily create 3D printed scale models directly from his existing CAD data that he uses for developing blueprints.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The prosthetics field has benefited greatly from using 3D printing. Custom shapes such as hearing aids and implants no longer require manual labor, with 3D printing they can be made with ease. This means substantially lower costs and lower production times. In addition to hearing aids, prosthetics and other assistive medical devices, braces and retainers are tailored specifically for the needs of their end user. A dental surgeon or orthodontist can 3D scan a clientâ€™s jaw and teeth and digitally construct and manufacture custom braces unique to the end user. The dental industry has embraced 3D printing and there are even dedicated 3D printer models designed specifically for manufacturing dental aids and molds.</p>

					<p>3D printing can be used for prototyping. Many individuals and companies have use 3D printing to visualize their idea. Recently, a design entrepreneur named Omar Rada had a goal of creating a professional chef's knife. He used 3D printing in his design process, which helped him refine the knife into a suitable design that could be manufactured at a low cost.</p>
